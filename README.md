---

## 🚀 Overview

**Gothi-Read** is an end-to-end OCR + font-group recognition framework developed for **Pattern Recognition Lab**.
The goal is to build and benchmark models capable of:

1. **Optical Character Recognition** — text transcription from scanned lines.
2. **Font Group Recognition** — predicting the font category for every character.

The repository now provides:

* A verified, Unicode-safe data pipeline
* Manifest generation and integrity checks
* Visualization of font annotations
* Evaluation scripts with unified model harness
* Metrics computation for CER/WER and font accuracy

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

* Configured **Python 3 + PyTorch + Hugging Face + CUDA**.
* Verified GPU availability and reproducibility across Colab and VS Code.
* Clear modular directory layout: `scripts/`, `src/`, `notebooks/,` `runs/`.

Main dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers jiwer pillow regex matplotlib
```

## 🧾 Dataset Handling and Validation

* `build_manifest.py` – scans dataset folders to create manifest CSVs listing `.jpg`, `.txt`, and `.font` triplets.
* `check_integrity.py` – summarizes file presence & alignment health.
* `make_test_split.py` – builds reproducible test subsets.
* Verified 100 % length alignment between text and font sequences.

**Validation Integrity Summary**

* Total lines : 4040
* Clean (ok=True) : 3827 (94.73 %)
* Missing txt : 213
* Length mismatches : 0
* ✅ 94.7 % of validation lines are clean — ready for evaluation.

## 🔡 Unicode-Safe Data Loader and Alignment

* Implemented in `src/icdar24.py`.
* Uses `regex \X` to split Unicode grapheme clusters — accurate for ligatures and diacritics.
* Includes two dataset classes:

  * `LineDataset` for flat folder structures.
  * `FlexibleLineDataset` for nested FAUBox-style layouts.
* Strict assertions ensure `len(characters) == len(font_labels)` for every sample.
* Optional filters for Latin-8 font groups and subset selection.

## 🖼 Visualization

`visualize_line.py` renders each line image with colored font labels per character.

**Features**

* Shows image + text with per-char color coding by font group.
* Legend auto-maps font labels → colors.
* Trims length mismatches safely.
* Saves visualizations to `exp/viz/`.

**Example command**

```bash
python scripts/visualize_line.py --manifest manifests/train.csv --num 8
```

## 🧮 Metrics Computation

* `src/metrics.py` computes:

  * **CER** (Character Error Rate)
  * **WER** (Word Error Rate)
* Uses **JiWER** for standard evaluation.
* Normalization pipeline prepared for future expansion to font-CER.
* Outputs aggregated JSON metrics for consistency across models.

## 🧠 Unified Model Evaluation Harness

`harness.py` provides a single interface to evaluate any OCR model.

**Functions**

```python
predict_lines(model_name, images) → List[str]  
evaluate(text_preds, text_gts) → {CER, WER, per_book, per_fontmix}
```

**Image Preprocessing**
grayscale → resize(height = 64) → pad to max width

**Outputs saved to**

```
runs/<model>/<date>/
  preds.txt  
  metrics.json  
  per_line.csv  # img_id, gt, pred, CER
```

Example:

```bash
python scripts/day3_harness.py   --manifest manifests/valid.csv   --model microsoft/trocr-base-printed   --height 64   --limit 1000
```

## ✅ Achievements

* Environment and GPU setup completed
* Dataset manifests validated (0 length mismatches)
* Unicode-safe data loader implemented
* Visualization utility verified
* Metric computation (CER/WER) operational
* Unified evaluation harness tested successfully
* Zero-shot TrOCR with beam vs greedy
* Zero-shot **PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv4 English)** baseline benchmarked on the same validation split.

### 🔁 Updated Zero-Shot OCR Baselines

All zero-shot models were re-evaluated on the same **valid_clean.csv** split using the new GPU-based TrOCR evaluation script (batched, no destructive resizing).

### 📌 Updated Observations (TrOCR)

* **TrOCR-base-handwritten** performs *much better* than printed models on historical Gothic / multi-font data.
* **TrOCR-large-printed** performs poorly in zero-shot mode due to domain mismatch.
* **PaddleOCR PP-OCRv4** remains the strongest zero-shot recognizer.

### 📊 **Updated Zero-Shot Results**

| run                        | CER          | WER          |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **paddle-ocr**             | **0.203298** | **0.755115** |
| **trocr-handwritten-beam** | 0.356683     | 2.168666     |
| trocr-handwritten-greedy   | 0.383486     | 2.331641     |
| trocr-large-printed        | 0.840328     | 5.109445     |

### 🔎 Interpretation

* PaddleOCR → **Best zero-shot** due to robustness and mixed-font training.
* TrOCR-handwritten → **Best TroCR variant**, recommended for fine-tuning.
* TrOCR-large-printed → Not suitable for zero-shot historical OCR.
* WER > CER is expected because word-level errors amplify even small character mistakes.

## 🔜 Next Steps

* Add font-classification head to OCR encoder for multi-task learning.
* Extend PaddleOCR experiments and integrate additional models: Donut, MMOCR, docTR.
* Benchmark all models on the same validation split.
* Compute joint **text CER + font-CER**.
* Build a leaderboard under `/runs/` for cross-model comparisons.

## 🏁 Summary

**Gothi-Read** now includes a validated data pipeline, visualization system, and unified model evaluation framework.
All data integrity, alignment, and evaluation steps are complete.
The project is ready for multi-model benchmarking and fine-tuning experiments for Pattern Recognition Lab.

PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv4, English, detection disabled, line-crop recognizer) currently achieves the best CER/WER among the evaluated models.
